EazeGraph
=========

EazeGraph is an Android library for creating beautiful and fancy charts in the easiest way possible.

This library currently offers 4 different chart types, which can be viewed below.

IMPORTANT:
This library is not intented for "mathematical" purposes like "achartengine" or "androidplot". It is intented to have a beautiful visual presentation of "user related"-data where only one value is provided and the rest is calculated dynamically.

So for example it's not possible to push 2D-values in the LineChart and let them plot just like in our beloved math lessons.

If you want such functionality either you use one of the libraries I named before or you wait some time until I finished a "mathematical plotting"-chart ;)

Currently LineCharts and BarCharts only support positive values. I will provide this functionality later.
